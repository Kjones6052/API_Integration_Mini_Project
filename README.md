# **Hello, World!**

The files in this repository are used to create my mini project for API Integration. 


Status: Project created, no files added yet

Overview:

In this project, I used an API fetch call to retrieve data from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/). With the data I created web pages to 
search for a Pokemon by name or ID, and each page displays a different set of information. A list of features and what each feature does is found below, and following the list of features in a list of files and their descriptions.


Features:

- Search: look up Pokemon information by using the Pokemon's name or ID, will display basic Pokemon information including image, name, base 
experience, and stats.

- Details: look up Pokemon information by using the Pokemon's name or ID, will display detailed Pokemon information including image, name, types, 
abilities, and stats.
